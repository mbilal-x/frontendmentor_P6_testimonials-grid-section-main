## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was my first real experience working with grids. 
I learned to make grid template and assign areas and order to the children element blocks(cards)
Also, I struggled to make this grid design similar to the design challenge, which after some experimentation I managed to get right, adding max-width to all cards. 

### Continued development
Practice working with grid layouts
